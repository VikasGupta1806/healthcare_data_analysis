# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a comprehensive healthcare dataset to uncover insights about patient demographics, medical conditions, hospital performance, and treatment outcomes. Using Power BI, the analysis includes detailed visualizations and interactive filters for dynamic exploration.

## Key Objectives
- **Patient Demographics:** Distribution by age, gender, and medical condition.
- **Hospital and Doctor Performance:** Metrics like billing amounts and length of stay.
- **Admission and Discharge Patterns:** Trends over time.
- **Test Results and Medications:** Correlation analysis.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
  - Handled missing values and standardized text formats.
  - Created calculated columns such as Length of Stay and Age Groups.
  - Ensured correct date formats for time intelligence functions.
  - Filtered out irrelevant data points.

- **Interactive Visualizations:**
  - **Overview Dashboard:** High-level summary of key metrics.
  - **Patient Demographics:** Visualizes the demographic distribution of patients.
  - **Detailed Analysis:** Trends over time, medical conditions by age group, and distribution of insurance providers.
  - **Hospital and Doctor Performance:** Performance metrics by hospital and doctor.
  - **Admission and Discharge Analysis:** Patterns in admissions and discharges.
  - **Test Results and Medications:** Correlation between medications and test results using heatmaps and bubble charts.

- **Interactivity:**
  - Slicers to filter data by gender, age group, medical condition, date range, and more.
